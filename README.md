## Welcome to the NobodyAtall Git Repo

### About Me
I'm a Computer Science Student & a CTF player that's passion in CyberSec & Penetration Testing. I've started learning Programming, Networking, & other IT Fundamental Knowledge during my diploma days (2016) & started to do pentesting & cyberSec research since 2019. In my git repo I'll be adding my writeup, exploit script, or any interesting stuff that I found throughout my pentesting. Here are my public profile links:-
